    "Encapsulation refers to the process of binding data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object.

The abstraction of the bank account object could be represented by its properties such as account number and balance, and methods such as deposit and withdraw. The user of this bank account object does not need to know the internal workings of how the bank manages the account, such as how the deposit or withdraw methods update the balance.\n",

    "The encapsulation of the bank account object could be achieved by declaring the properties such as account number and balance as private, and providing the methods such as deposit and withdraw as public. This encapsulation ensures that the user can only access the account information through the provided methods and cannot directly access or modify the account number or balance properties.\n",
